After you have cloned the repository, you can build the ADTs by performing
the following shell commands:

$ autoreconf -if
$ ./configure
$ make clean
$ make
$ make install
$ (cd src; sh -v test.sh)

Note that the libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib and the .h files
are installed in /usr/local/include/adts.
